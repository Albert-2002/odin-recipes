    <h1>Teach Yourself Computer Science</h1>
    <hr />
    <p>
      If you’re a self-taught engineer or bootcamp grad, you owe it to yourself
      to learn computer science.<br />
      Thankfully, you can give yourself a world-class CS education without
      investing years and a small fortune in a degree program.

      There are plenty of resources out there, but some are better than others.
      You don't need yet another "200+ Free Online Courses" listicle.<br />
      You need answers to these questions:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <!-- Add your list items here -->
      <li><strong>Which subjects</strong> should you learn, and why?</li>
      <li>
        <strong>What resources</strong> should you use to learn these subjects?
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>This guide is our attempt to definitively answer these questions.</p>

    <h3>TL;DR:</h3>
    <p>
      Study all nine subjects below, in roughly the presented order, using
      either the suggested textbook or video lecture series, but ideally
      both.<br />
      Aim for 100-200 hours of study of each topic, then revisit the favorites
      throughout your life.
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Subject: Programming</strong>
        <p>
          Don’t be the person who “never quite understood” something like
          recursion.<br />
          <strong>Book</strong>:
          <em>Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs</em><br />
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Subject: Computer Architecture</strong>
        <p>
          If you don’t have a solid mental model of how a computer actually
          works, all of your higher-level abstractions will be brittle.<br />
          <strong>Book</strong>:
          <em>Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective</em><br />
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Subject: Algorithms and Data Structures</strong>
        <p>
          If you don’t know how to use ubiquitous data structures like stacks,
          queues, trees, and graphs, you won’t be able to solve challenging
          problems.<br />
          <strong>Book</strong>: <em>The Algorithm Design Manual</em><br />
