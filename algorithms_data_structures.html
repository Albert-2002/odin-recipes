    <hr />

    <p>
      We agree with decades of common wisdom that familiarity with common
      algorithms and data structures is one of the most empowering aspects of a
      computer science education. <br />
      This is also a great place to train oneâ€™s general problem-solving
      abilities, which will pay off in every other area of study.
